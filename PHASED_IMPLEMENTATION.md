I've created a comprehensive spec for the complete Sylves C library port. Here's what we've accomplished:

Spec Summary
Requirements Document: Defined 19 major requirements covering every aspect of the original C# Sylves library:

Core infrastructure and type system
Complete grid interface with all grid types (Square, Hex, Triangle, Cube, Mesh, Voronoi, Substitution tilings, etc.)
Grid modifiers (Transform, Mask, Wrap, Bijection, Relaxation, etc.)
Comprehensive algorithms (A*, Dijkstra, spanning trees, mesh operations)
Voronoi/Delaunay computational geometry
Deformation and interpolation systems
Export capabilities and performance optimization
Robust error handling and cross-platform compatibility
Design Document: Outlined the complete architecture:

VTable-based polymorphism for C
Memory management strategy with clear ownership
Modular component architecture
Performance considerations and platform compatibility
Comprehensive error handling system
Implementation Plan: Created 19 major tasks broken down into 76 detailed subtasks:

Each task builds incrementally on previous work
Clear requirements traceability
Comprehensive testing at each stage
Performance validation and cross-platform testing
Complete documentation and examples
Key Features of This Spec
Complete Coverage: This is a full port, not a subset - every feature from the C# implementation
Incremental Development: Tasks build systematically from core types to advanced algorithms
Production Ready: Includes performance optimization, memory management, and robust error handling
Cross-Platform: Designed for embedded systems, mobile, and desktop platforms
Well Tested: Comprehensive testing strategy with validation against original C# implementation
The spec is now ready for implementation by an AI agent. Each task is concrete and actionable, with clear acceptance criteria and requirements traceability. The agent can work through the tasks systematically to create a complete, production-ready C99 port of the Sylves geometry library.

1. Audit & Development Environment Setup
Establish CI pipeline, coding standards, and perform a gap analysis between current square-only code and the full specification to generate a living backlog for all missing features.
2. Complete Core Types, Math, Memory & Error Systems
Finish Vector/Matrix/Quaternion math, Cell/Connection/Aabb/TRS structs, standardized error codes, and create create/destroy patterns with unit tests to lock foundational behaviour.
3. Implement Polymorphic Infrastructure (Grid, CellType, Bound VTables)
Introduce vtable structs, base objects, factory/registry helpers, and default helpers for property queries so every concrete implementation plugs in consistently.
4. Build Full CellType Suite (Square, Hex, Triangle, Cube)
For each cell type implement directions, corners, rotations/reflections, composition functions, and geometric corner positions with exhaustive tests.
5. Deliver Core Grid Implementations (Hex, Triangle, Cube)
Create data structures, navigation (TryMove), spatial queries, bounds handling, center/corner math, polygon/mesh generation, and un/bounded variants for each grid.
6. Add Advanced Grids (Mesh, Voronoi, Substitution, Periodic, Prism, Jittered)
Implement mesh-backed face grids, Delaunay-derived Voronoi grids, Penrose/Ammann-Beenker substitution tilings, Archimedean periodic grids, 2D-to-3D prism extrusions, and jittered perturbations with necessary coordinate systems.
7. Implement Grid Modifiers Framework & Variants
Create transparent wrapper modifiers (Transform, Mask, Wrap, Biject, Relax, Nested, Ravel, PlanarPrism) with correct delegation, state management, and unit tests on composition.
8. Complete Bounds System
Provide SquareBound, HexBound, TriangleBound, CubeBound, MaskBound plus intersection/union/containment algorithms and efficient cell enumeration.
9. Implement Pathfinding & Graph Algorithms
Provide reusable A*, Dijkstra, BFS, Kruskal spanning tree, and region outlining; expose configurable callbacks and verify correctness on all grid types.
10. Add Computational Geometry (Robust Delaunay/Voronoi & Utilities)
Implement 2D incremental Delaunay with robust predicates, planar & spherical Voronoi generation, and generic geometry helpers (hull, intersections, in-polygon).
11. Provide Mesh Operations & Conway Operators
Create MeshData structure, dual mesh builder, Conway transforms, subdivision, raycasting with acceleration structures, and common repair/merge utilities.
12. Introduce Deformation & Interpolation Layer
Implement Deformation interface, barycentric/ bilinear interpolation, cylindrical/spherical mappings, and composition utilities for curved surface support.
13. Export & Visualization Tooling
Add SVG exporter for 2D grids and OBJ/PLY exporters for meshes with material/UV support; include simple visualization helpers for debugging.
14. Performance Optimization (Memory Pools, Spatial Indexing, Caching)
Integrate pool allocators for transient objects, spatial hashing/trees for queries, and result caching with invalidation policies; benchmark and tune.
15. Comprehensive Testing & Validation Suite
Implement unit/integration/performance tests across modules, Valgrind leak checks, cross-platform builds, and numeric equivalence tests against original C# results.
16. Documentation, Examples, Build & Release
Generate full Doxygen docs, write migration guide and example programs, finalize CMake packaging, and prepare versioned release with changelog and binaries.
