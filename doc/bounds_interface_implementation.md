# Sylves C Port: Base Bounds Interface

## Overview

This document outlines the complete implementation of the base bounds interface for the Sylves C port.

### Completed Work

- **SylvesBound VTable Structure**: Defined and extended to include necessary operations like intersect, union, and containment.

- **Creation and Destruction Functions**: Implemented functions to create and destroy different bound types ensuring consistent memory management.

- **Type Registration and Factory System**: Developed a registration system to support different bound types and integrate additional custom types.

- **Basic Operations**: Implemented containment checks, extents calculations, and ensured type-specific logic is encapsulated within vtable functions.

### Files Modified
- `sylves-c/src/include/sylves/bounds.h`
- `sylves-c/src/internal/bound_internal.h`
- `sylves-c/src/bounds.c`

### Next Steps

- Extend concrete bound types implementations.
- Complete bounds operations including intersection and union for all combinations.
- Write comprehensive unit tests covering all base interface functionality.

### Conclusion
The base bounds interface provides a robust foundation for adding concrete and complex bounds operations, paving the way for complete grid constraints management in the Sylves C port.
